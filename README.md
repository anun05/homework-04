## Description
This assignment was a stuggle for me to build in the beginnning. I had a lot of help, but I recenlty came back to it, wrote notes, and fixed the stuff that was not working. Now it is functional. There is one thing I could not figure out, but I beleive I will figure it out sooner or later. 
More of the story, this assigment is a code quiz. The User will be prompted with a series of question that they must answer, once they do that, they enter their name and their name will be saved aong with their score. There will be a score board that allow them to view the scores. 



## Usage
The use of this project is pretty easy I would say. It simply requires one to start the game button and answer some questions and in the end just record those answers.
